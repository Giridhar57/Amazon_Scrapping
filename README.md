# Amazon_Scrapping

I have created this scraping tool by using simple libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup for extracting HTML source code of the product page. Inorder to tackle with the crawler detection by Amazon, I have used a Python library known as Faker which gives us random user_agents for the headers to act as a real browser. Not every request will be successful, but it was iterated until the required data is found.
